            <description>Hello guys, here is the 2nd part of blog. This is the most critical bug i have ever found in TryHackMe, using this bug an attacker can edit and delete any rooms of THM.
I uploaded the POC video to Youtube.
Shortest Bug Explanation: Any room is edited through a parameter with a room name, i created two room with two different accounts. While deleting/editing the 1st room name i intercepted the request and change the 1st room to 2nd room name, it throwed 403.</description>

<strong>Shortest Bug Explanation:</strong> Any room is edited through a parameter with a room name, i created two room with two different accounts. While deleting/editing the 1st room name i intercepted the request and change the 1st room to 2nd room name, it throwed 403. In next attempt i added a second parameter(Parameter Pollution) with the 2nd room name, the check bypassed and the other room got delete/edited.<br>

            <description>Hello guys, during my hunting i find two vulnerabilities in THM, today i will talk about the first vuln which is S3 Bucket misconfiguration.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is s3 bucket and how it leads to vulns check the references.
1. S3 Bucket Misconfiguation Leads to deletion of any images(profile,room images,banner etc..) When, uploading my profile pic, i saw it was uploaded to a s3 bucket.
My first thought was can i perform read, upload and delete operation in the S3 bucket?</description>

<h3 id="1-s3-bucket-misconfiguation-leads-to-deletion-of-any-imagesprofileroom-imagesbanner-etc">1. S3 Bucket Misconfiguation Leads to deletion of any images(profile,room images,banner etc..)</h3>
<p>When, uploading my profile pic, i saw it was uploaded to a s3 bucket.<br>
My first thought was can i perform read, upload and delete operation in the S3 bucket?<br>
After that i tried 3 operations in the bucket: READ, UPLOAD, DELETE<br>
<strong>AWS S3 Commands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>‚ùå READ Contents: aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/ &ndash;no-sign-request</li>
<li>‚ùå Upload Content: aws s3 cp poc.txt s3://bucket-name/poc.txt &ndash;no-sign-request</li>
<li>‚úÖ Delete Content: aws rm s3://bucketname/user-avatars/my-pic.jpeg &ndash;no-sign-request<br>
Only delete operation was successfull, this proved that i can delete any pics from the bucket.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
An attacker can delete any pic in TryHackMe which includes profile pic of anyusers,room icon, room banner etc..</p>
<p><strong>How I made the POC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a pic in my 2nd account.</li>
<li>Visit my 2nd account&rsquo;s public profile from the 1st account.</li>
<li>Using inspect, i copied the profile pic of that 2nd account.</li>
<li>Deleted the pic using aws command -&gt; aws s3 rm s3://tryhackme-images/user-avatars/2ndpic.png &ndash;no-sign-request</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to find S3 Buckets?</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check website&rsquo;s source code(JS,HTML)</li>
<li>Check CSP headers</li>
<li>Google and Github dorking</li>
<li>Use Tools like <a href="https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner">https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner</a> etc..</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>When I reported the misconfiguation, they fixed it quickly in one day and rewarded me $$$</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and wait for the part 2 :)</p>

            <description>Hello, amazing hackers my name is Sudip Roy and i am an InfoSec student and part-time Bug Hunter.This is my first writeup about a critical vulnerability which i found on a website(Vdp). Hope you guys will like it and learn something new from it.
Lets get started, The website provides cloud-based consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution. For testing purposes i signup using my account, select developer pro(extra features), created a app and looked for every features of the website, 1 hour later i decided to play with the delete account feature from the settings page.</description>

<p>Lets get started, The website provides cloud-based consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution.
For testing purposes i signup using my account, select developer pro(extra features), created a app and looked for every features of the website, 1 hour later i decided to play with the delete account feature from the settings page. I request for the delete account and checked the request in burpsuite and send the request to repeater and drop it.</p>
<p>The request looked like this(1st IDOR):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DELETE /account/customer? HTTP/1.1
Host: redacted-api.redacted.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Connection: close

{&#34;uid&#34;:&#34;4adddbea4e3646a0b951ce4822075707&#34;}
</code></pre><p>Now, after looking the request, we can easily identify uid(user identification) parameter is used so the website maybe prone to idor.
I made 2nd account and request for the delete account feature, the request was exactly same and uid is different. I copy the uid code of the 2nd account and replace uid code with first request&rsquo;s code. After sending the request the my 2nd account was successfully deleted.(1st IDOR)</p>
<p>Here the impact is nothing because how will the attacker get&rsquo;s the victim&rsquo;s uid. So i needed to find the victim&rsquo;s uid.</p>
<p>After spending some time with the website, i found that i can invite a team-member to my app which i created when signing up in the website. So i invited the user to my app and checked the requests made by website. While checking i found this interesting request:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>GET /team/userprofile?email=nexas60891%40rebation.com&amp; HTTP/1.1
Host: adminconsole-api.redacted.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Te: trailers
Connection: close
</code></pre><p>I send the request to the repeater and send the request. The request showed some information related to the victim&rsquo;s email including uid code.

</code></pre><p>I copy the uid from this response and replace with uid code in the 1st acccount&rsquo;s request -&gt; Send the request -&gt; The victim&rsquo;s account was permanently deleted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another thing i noticed that <a href="https://adminconsole-api.redacted.com/team/userprofile?email=">https://adminconsole-api.redacted.com/team/userprofile?email=</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&amp; HTTP/1.1
This email parameter takes any email and return it&rsquo;s uid so i can delete any dev. or admin&rsquo;s account easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always checks for idor if any uid/guid or number present in the request and check every http request using burp.</li>
<li>One IDOR tip -&gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/intigriti/status/1217794181982302208/photo/1">https://twitter.com/intigriti/status/1217794181982302208/photo/1</a></li>
