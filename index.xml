      <description>Hello guys, during my hunting i find two vulnerabilities in THM, today i will talk about the first vuln which is S3 Bucket misconfiguration.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is s3 bucket and how it leads to vulns check the references.
1. S3 Bucket Misconfiguation Leads to deletion of any images(profile,room images,banner etc..) When, uploading my profile pic, i saw it was uploaded to a s3 bucket.
My first thought was can i perform read, upload and delete operation in the S3 bucket?</description>

      <description>Hello, amazing hackers my name is Sudip Roy and i am an InfoSec student and part-time Bug Hunter.This is my first writeup about a critical vulnerability which i found on a website(Vdp). Hope you guys will like it and learn something new from it.
Lets get started, The website provides cloud-based consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution. For testing purposes i signup using my account, select developer pro(extra features), created a app and looked for every features of the website, 1 hour later i decided to play with the delete account feature from the settings page.</description>
